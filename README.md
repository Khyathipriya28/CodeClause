Breast Cancer Classification
This project focuses on breast cancer classification using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. The dataset is loaded using scikit-learn's breast cancer dataset module. It consists of 30 features extracted from digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass and a target variable indicating the diagnosis (malignant or benign).

The data is preprocessed, and a logistic regression model is employed for classification. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained on the training data. Accuracy scores are calculated for both the training and testing datasets.

The model's performance is then demonstrated by making predictions on a sample input data point. The predictions are then used to classify the input as either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous).
